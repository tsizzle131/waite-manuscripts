By Tristan Waite 12/21/2024
Abstract
This paper proposes a novel synthesis of adaptive cloaking technologies and exoskeleton frameworks, merging nanobot-driven meta-materials and AI to create a dynamic, shape-modifying exoskeleton. This system would not only enhance stealth but also augment human strength, monitor biometrics for preventive medicine, and provide real-time environmental adaptability. By integrating cloaking mechanisms with biomimetic functionalities, this technology could redefine the scope of wearable robotics and intelligent materials in both civilian and military domains.
